Chapter 1 - DNA Replication.
- Begins in the Origin of Replication - OriC

Why is it important to know the OriC? - When we do genetic manipulations, we need to ensure that the OriC remains intact
so that the cell can continue to replicate without a problem.

How do we find the OriC purely computationally? - This is rather hard. If we were doing it the biologist way, we would cut off
parts of the genome and then check if the cells replicate. If they did not, we possibly removed the OriC. As a computer scientist,
this is a little bit harder to achieve. We know that protein named DnaA initiates the replication when it binds to one or multiple
boxes of DNA called DnaA boxes. Why multiple? Well if a mutation occurs, then having other undamaged copies will ensure that 
replication can continue. They hold the same DNA transcripts. The question is, can we find something in the genome that stands
out?

PROBLEM: Here we have our first problem, counting K-mers. We try to find how many times a string is found in a block of text.
Be careful, the strings may overlap! As such we need to use a sliding window technique.

PROBLEM: The second problem appears almost immediately. Sure, we found the frequency of a specific K-mer, but what if we don't know
what to look for? Could we possibly search for the frequency of all K-mers? Sure we can. We can do this by looping through the text
once and saving each value in a dictionary/map. At the end simply filter for the ones with the highest count.

DnaA boxes are usually 9 nucleotides long. This has been declared experimentally. When using our program, we can find that some
long k-mers appear relatively frequently, despite that being statistically unlikely. As such, that means that they must hold some
genetic value and are worth preserving - DnaA box. It turns out that there are multiple K-mers but they are somewhat similar...
some are reverse compliments of others! 

DNA strands and their compliments are always read in 5 -> 3 direction ;).

PROBLEM: Some strands have reverse complements. The DnaA protein does not care if it binds to the DnaA box or its reverse complement
(also considered a DnaA box). Those happen due to the replication of the DNA and the existence of 2 strands, going
in separate directions. Thus we need to find the most common occurrences of a k-mer in a string and then find the reverse complement.

PROBLEM: From here we may deduce that we have found the OriC and that those dna k-mers are the DnaA boxes. That may be so, but what 
if those statistically unreasonable k-mers appear rather frequently throughout the whole genome? Afterall, DnaA boxes should be found
only at the OriC site. We have to check the whole genome and check where those k-mers occur. If we are correct, we will see a clump
of such k-mers at our OriC region and an absence everywhere else.

Checking the Vibrio Cholerae genome returns the following locations: 60039 98409 129189 152283 152354 152411 163207 197028 200160
 357976 376771 392723 532935 600085 622755 1065555

We can deduce that most likely, the bacteria has 3 or 2 OriC points. Between 150 000 - 163 000, 35 000 - 393 000 and the last one
around the 600 000 - 623 000. After doing the same with the reverse compliment, we find it at around 150 000 - 152 000. As such,
we can be fairly certain that this is an OriC and it's DnaA box. Is it the same for all bacterial genomes? Of course not. They
have different Dna A boxes, we confirm that after doing the same experiment with different genomes.

PROBLEM: We have a new genome and we need to find the OriC and the DnaA boxes. We know that we need to find some k-mers that clump 
together in a space. We do not know how long they are, but we can try to guess, maybe around 9 bases. So let us try to find all 
k-mers that clump together in a specific range. The OriC is usually around 500 bases big, so we will choose to search for a clump of
k-mers every 500 bases of our DNA strand.
